# background: 
An Avl-Tree is a tree in which for all node v in the tree it holds that: |height(v.left) - height(v.right)| <= 1. It can be shown that the height of an Avl Tree with n nodes is O(log(n)).

# AVL-TreeList:
In this project, a fellow student and I implemted list using an AVL-Tree. because the height of an AVL-Tree with n nodes is O(log(n)) - operations such as: insert, delete and retrieve can be done in O(logn(n)) time.
